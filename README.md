# Shut the fuck up
An android app to hermetically mute the phone.

The issue that made me build this app was that I use whatsapp as my main way to make calls (voip), but whatsapp doesn't respect the "do not disturb" and it accurs to me that applications don't have to respect it - this app just mutes the phone in and way possible, it activates DND and mutes all audio streams.

It seems that this issue is not my own ([1],[2],[3]) so I open source this, so people can use it themselves.

The app creates a quick custom setting to make it easier to use (the paw icon in the screen shot üêæ ).
